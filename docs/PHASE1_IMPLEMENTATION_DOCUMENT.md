## Approach Used for Phase 1 Implementation

### 1. **Simplified Architecture Strategy**

The Phase 1 approach focused on creating a **minimal viable MLOps platform** without the complexity of OpenLineage integration:

#### Core Principles:
- **Service Isolation**: Each service operates independently with clear interfaces
- **Mock Implementations**: Simplified versions of complex services for rapid prototyping
- **Docker Compose Orchestration**: Single-file deployment for easy setup and testing
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring for service availability
- **Network Isolation**: Secure communication between services

### 2. **Component Selection and Rationale**

#### **PostgreSQL Database**
- **Why**: Centralized metadata storage for all services
- **Implementation**: Single instance serving MLflow, ModelCatalogue, and Feast metadata
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, easy backup/restore

#### **Redis Cache**
- **Why**: High-performance caching for Feast online feature serving
- **Implementation**: Lightweight in-memory store for real-time feature access
- **Benefits**: Sub-millisecond latency, simple deployment

#### **MinIO Object Storage**
- **Why**: S3-compatible storage for artifacts and feature data
- **Implementation**: Self-hosted object storage with web console
- **Benefits**: Cost-effective, familiar S3 API, local development support

#### **MLflow Server**
- **Why**: Industry-standard experiment tracking and model registry
- **Implementation**: Official Python image with custom startup script
- **Benefits**: Mature ecosystem, extensive integrations, active community

#### **API Gateway (Mock)**
- **Why**: Centralized authentication and request routing
- **Implementation**: FastAPI-based mock service with OAuth simulation
- **Benefits**: Security layer, rate limiting, service discovery

#### **ModelCatalogue (Mock)**
- **Why**: Model registry and discovery service
- **Implementation**: FastAPI-based mock with basic CRUD operations
- **Benefits**: Model lifecycle management, metadata storage

#### **MLflow Pod (Jupyter)**
- **Why**: Containerized execution environment for experiments
- **Implementation**: Jupyter notebook with MLflow integration
- **Benefits**: Isolated execution, resource management, interactive development

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**

#### **Docker Compose Approach**
```yaml
# Key design decisions:
- Single network for service communication
- Health checks for service dependencies
- Volume persistence for data and artifacts
- Environment variable configuration
- Service discovery through container names
```

#### **Service Communication Pattern**
```
User → API Gateway → ML Services → Storage Layer
```

#### **Data Flow Design**
```
Raw Data → Feast → MLflow → ModelCatalogue → Deployment
```

### 4. **Configuration Management**

#### **Environment-Based Configuration**
- **Database URLs**: Centralized connection strings
- **Service Endpoints**: Internal service discovery
- **Authentication**: Mock OAuth tokens for development
- **Storage**: S3-compatible MinIO configuration

#### **Health Check Strategy**
- **PostgreSQL**: `pg_isready` command
- **Redis**: `redis-cli ping` command
- **MinIO**: HTTP health endpoint
- **Services**: Custom health endpoints

### 5. **Security Considerations**

#### **Network Security**
- **Isolated Network**: All services communicate within Docker network
- **No External Exposure**: Only necessary ports exposed to host
- **Service-to-Service**: Internal communication without authentication

#### **Authentication Mock**
- **OAuth Simulation**: Mock token generation and validation
- **API Gateway**: Centralized authentication point
- **Service Integration**: Token passing to downstream services

### 6. **Monitoring and Observability**

#### **Health Checks**
- **Service Level**: Individual service health monitoring
- **Dependency Checks**: Service startup dependencies
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on service failures

#### **Logging Strategy**
- **Container Logs**: Docker Compose log aggregation
- **Service Logs**: Individual service logging
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Why No OpenLineage in Phase 1?**

- **Minimal Functionality**: Core operations without full features
- **Easy Replacement**: Simple to replace with real services later

#### **Development Benefits**
- **Local Development**: No external dependencies
- **Testing**: Predictable behavior for testing
- **Documentation**: Clear API contracts

### 3. **Storage Architecture**

#### **Shared Storage Strategy**
- **PostgreSQL**: Single database for all metadata
- **MinIO**: Single object store for all artifacts
- **Redis**: Single cache for all real-time data

#### **Benefits**
- **Simplified Management**: Fewer storage systems to manage
- **Cost Effective**: Reduced infrastructure complexity
- **Development Friendly**: Easy local setup and testing
