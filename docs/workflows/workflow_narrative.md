# End-to-End MLOps Workflow Narrative

## Overview
This document describes the complete workflow from data ingestion to model deployment, with full OpenLineage integration for lineage tracking and metadata management.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion and Feature Engineering
**Actor**: Data Engineer  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**OpenLineage Events**: Feature ingestion, data transformation

**Process**:
1. Raw customer data is ingested from various sources (databases, APIs, files)
2. Data is cleaned, validated, and transformed into features
3. Features are stored in Feast feature store with point-in-time correctness
4. OpenLineage events are emitted for:
   - Source dataset ingestion
   - Feature transformation processes
   - Feature store updates

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
Raw Data → Data Validation → Feature Engineering → Feast Feature Store
```

### 2. MLflow Experiment Setup
**Actor**: Data Scientist  
**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**OpenLineage Events**: Experiment creation, run initialization

**Process**:
1. Data scientist creates a new MLflow experiment
2. Experiment metadata is logged (name, description, tags)
3. OpenLineage events are emitted for experiment creation
4. User authentication is verified through API Gateway

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
User → API Gateway → MLflow → Experiment Creation → OpenLineage Event
```

### 3. Model Training with Feature Consumption
**Actor**: Data Scientist  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**OpenLineage Events**: Run start, feature consumption, model training

**Process**:
1. MLflow run is started within the experiment
2. Features are consumed from Feast feature store
3. Model training is performed with hyperparameter tuning
4. Training metrics and model artifacts are logged
5. OpenLineage events are emitted for:
   - Run initialization
   - Feature consumption from Feast
   - Model training completion
   - Artifact generation

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
MLflow Run → Feast Feature Store → Model Training → Model Artifacts
```

### 4. Model Validation
**Actor**: ML Engineer  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**OpenLineage Events**: Model validation, quality checks

**Process**:
1. Trained model is loaded from MLflow
2. Validation dataset is prepared
3. Model performance is evaluated against business criteria
4. Data quality and model quality checks are performed
5. OpenLineage events are emitted for validation results

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
Trained Model → Validation Dataset → Quality Checks → Validation Results
```

### 5. Model Registration (if validation passes)
**Actor**: ML Engineer  
**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**OpenLineage Events**: Model registration, metadata linking

**Process**:
1. If validation passes, model is registered in ModelCatalogue
2. Model metadata is linked to source experiment and features
3. Model versioning and lifecycle management is set up
4. OpenLineage events are emitted for:
   - Model registration
   - Metadata linking between MLflow and ModelCatalogue
   - Feature lineage connections

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
MLflow Experiment → Model Validation → ModelCatalogue → Model Registry
```

### 6. Model Deployment
**Actor**: ML Engineer  
**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**OpenLineage Events**: Model deployment, environment configuration

**Process**:
1. Model is deployed to production environment
2. Deployment configuration is applied
3. Model serving endpoints are created
4. OpenLineage events are emitted for deployment tracking

**Lineage Tracking**:
```
ModelCatalogue → Deployment Config → Production Environment → Serving Endpoints
```

## OpenLineage Event Flow

### Event Types Emitted:
1. **Dataset Events**: Raw data, features, model artifacts
2. **Job Events**: Data processing, model training, validation, deployment
3. **Run Events**: Individual execution instances
4. **Facet Events**: Metadata, schemas, quality metrics

### Event Destinations:
- All events are sent to Marquez (OpenLineage backend)
- Marquez stores lineage graph and metadata
- Web UI provides visualization and querying capabilities

## Traceability Queries

### 1. Which datasets and features produced a given model?
```sql
-- Query Marquez for model lineage
SELECT 
    d.name as dataset_name,
    d.namespace as dataset_namespace,
    j.name as job_name,
    r.runId as run_id
FROM datasets d
JOIN lineage_events le ON d.id = le.dataset_id
JOIN runs r ON le.run_id = r.id
JOIN jobs j ON r.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.name LIKE '%model_training%'
AND r.facets->>'model_name' = 'loan_approval_model'
```

### 2. If dataset X is updated, which models are impacted?
```sql
-- Query for downstream impact
WITH RECURSIVE lineage_tree AS (
    SELECT d.id, d.name, d.namespace, 0 as level
    FROM datasets d
    WHERE d.name = 'customer_data'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT d2.id, d2.name, d2.namespace, lt.level + 1
    FROM datasets d2
    JOIN lineage_events le ON d2.id = le.dataset_id
    JOIN lineage_tree lt ON le.source_dataset_id = lt.id
    WHERE lt.level < 10
)
SELECT DISTINCT d.name, d.namespace, lt.level
FROM lineage_tree lt
JOIN datasets d ON lt.id = d.id
WHERE d.name LIKE '%model%'
ORDER BY lt.level;
```

### 3. What lineage exists between datasets → features → experiments → models?
```sql
-- Complete lineage query
SELECT 
    source_d.name as source_dataset,
    source_d.namespace as source_namespace,
    feature_j.name as feature_job,
    mlflow_j.name as mlflow_job,
    model_j.name as model_job,
    r.runId as run_id,
    r.facets->>'model_name' as model_name
FROM datasets source_d
JOIN lineage_events le1 ON source_d.id = le1.dataset_id
JOIN jobs feature_j ON le1.job_id = feature_j.id
JOIN runs r ON feature_j.id = r.job_id
JOIN lineage_events le2 ON r.id = le2.run_id
JOIN jobs mlflow_j ON le2.job_id = mlflow_j.id
JOIN lineage_events le3 ON mlflow_j.id = le3.job_id
JOIN jobs model_j ON le3.job_id = model_j.id
WHERE source_d.name = 'customer_data'
AND model_j.name LIKE '%model_registration%';
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

3. **Data Quality Metrics**: Validation results and quality scores
4. **Model Performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall trends
